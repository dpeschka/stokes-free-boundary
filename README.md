# MATLAB solver for Stokes free boundary problem

Description: MATLAB code that solves a Stokes free boundary problem with dynamic contact angle using isoparametric finite elements in 2D

```math
-\nabla\cdot\sigma = f\quad\text{and}\quad \nabla\cdot{u}=0 \qquad \text{conservation of momentum and mass in }\Omega(t)
```
